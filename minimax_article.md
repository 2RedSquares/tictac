In this article, I'd like to show an implementation of a tic-tac-toe solver using the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm. Because it's such a simple game with relatively few states, I thought that tic-tac-toe would be a convenient case study for machine learning and AI experimentation. Here I've implemented a simple algorithm called minimax.

The basic idea behind minimax is that we want to know how to play under the assumption that both players will play as well as possible. For example, let's say it's _X's_ turn and _X_ plays a particular move. What's the value of this move? Suppose that _O_ can respond in one of two ways: In the first case, _O_ wins on the next move. The other move by _O_ leads to a win by _X_ on the following move. Since _O_ can win, we consider the original potential move by _X_ a bad one - it leads to a loss. We ignore the fact that _X_ could theoretically win if _O_ makes a mistake. We'll define a value of _1_ for a win by _X_, _-1_ for a win by _O_, and _0_ for a draw. In the above scenario, since _O_ can win on the next move, the original move by _X_ is assigned a value of _-1_.

The minimax algorithm applies this strategy recursively from any given position - we explore the game from a given starting position until we reach all possible end-of-game states. We can represent this as a tree, with each level of the tree showing the possible board positions for a given player's turn. When we reach an end-of-game state, there's no choice to be made, so the value returned is the board state value, that is _1_ if _X_ won, _-1_ if _O_ won, and _0_ if it was a draw. If it is _X's_ turn and it's not a final board state, then we choose the _maximum_ of the values of the next possible moves from that position in the tree. This represents the best possible option for _X_. If it is _O_'s turn, then we choose the _minimum_ of these values, which is the best option for _O_. We keep propagating the position values upward toward the root position, alternating between maximum and minimum values as we go - which is of course where the minimax algorithm gets its name.

> It's worth emphasizing that minimax works fine for a toy scenario like tic-tac-toe because there are few distinct game positions - 765 if we take rotation and reflection symmetry into account. For more complex scenarios, minimax would, at the very least, have to be combined with other techniques. I haven't implemented it here, but [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) can be used to reduce the number of positions that need to be visited. The basic idea is that if we know that exploring a give subtree won't produce a better result than what we've already got, then we don't need to bother with it. There are additional heuristics as well, like [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) that can be applied to simplify the state space of scenarios where minimax would result in too many combinations to keep track of. These days, for games like chess and go, deep learning techiques have proven remarkably effective, far more effective in fact than heuristics-based approaches like minimax, alpha-beta pruning, MCTS, etc.

The diagram below shows an example of minimax being applied to a board position:

In the above diagram, for positions in the _max_ levels of the tree - where it is _X's_ turn - we choose the maximum value of the possible continuations. For the positions in the _min_ levels of the tree - where it is _O's_ turn - we take the minimim value. In each case, we are looking for the best possible result for the current player. If there is only one possible continuation, we take the value of that position, since there is no other choice. If the position is an end-of-game state, then the value of that position is the result of that game - that's the terminating condition for the recursive calls. As we can see, the best _X_ can do here (as long as _O_ doesn't make a mistake) is to get a draw by playing in the top right-hand corner of the board.

Let's briefly look at the code needed to implement minimax. Note that this code is not written for maximum efficiency, just to illustrate the basic concepts. The project is available on [github](https://github.com/nestedsoftware/tictac). This code is from [`minimax.py`](https://github.com/nestedsoftware/tictac/blob/master/tictac/minimax.py):

```python
def play_minimax_move(board):
    move_value_pairs = get_move_value_pairs(board)
    move = filter_best_move(board, move_value_pairs)

    return play_move(board, move)
```

`play_minimax_move` determines which move to play for a given board position. First it gets the values corresponding to each possible move, then plays the move with the maximum value if it's _X's_ turn, or the move with the minimum value if it's _O's_ turn.

`get_move_value_pairs` gets the value for each of the next moves from the current board position:

```python
def get_move_value_pairs(board):
    valid_move_indexes = get_valid_move_indexes(board)

    assert not_empty(valid_move_indexes), "never call with an end-position"

    move_value_pairs = [(m, get_position_value(play_move(board, m)))
                        for m in valid_move_indexes]

    return move_value_pairs
```

`get_position_value`, below, either obtains the value of the current position from a cache, or calculates it directly by exploring the game tree. Without caching, playing even a single game takes about 1.5 minutes on my computer. Caching takes that down to about 0.5 seconds! Even for a single game, a full search will encounter the same position over again many times. Caching allows us to speed this process up considerably: If we've seen this position before, we don't need to re-explore that part of the game tree.

```python
def get_position_value(board):
    if is_gameover(board):
        return get_game_result(board)

    cached_position_value, found = get_position_value_from_cache(board)
    if found:
        return cached_position_value

    position_value = calculate_position_value(board)

    put_position_value_in_cache(board, position_value)

    return position_value
```

The caching code also takes into account positions that are equivalent. That includes rotations as well as horizontal and vertical reflections. There are 4 equivalent positions under rotation - 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. There are also 4 reflections - flipping the original position horizontally and vertically, and also rotating by 90° first, then flipping horizontally and vertically. Flipping the remaining rotations is redundant - rotating by 180° and flipping will produce the same positions as flipping the original position. Rotating by 270° and flipping will produce the same positions as flipping the 90° rotation. Without taking into account rotation and reflection, a single game takes approximately 2 seconds, compared to the 0.5 seconds with caching enabled for rotations and reflections as well. `get_symmetrical_board_orientations` obtains all of the equivalent board positions:

```python
def get_symmetrical_board_orientations(board_2d):
    orientations = [board_2d]

    current_board_2d = board_2d
    for i in range(3):
        current_board_2d = np.rot90(current_board_2d)
        orientations.append(current_board_2d)

    orientations.append(np.flipud(board_2d))
    orientations.append(np.fliplr(board_2d))

    orientations.append(np.flipud(np.rot90(board_2d)))
    orientations.append(np.fliplr(np.rot90(board_2d)))

    return orientations
```

`calculate_position_value` does the actual heavy lifting of finding the value for a given board position by recursively exploring the game tree. We recursively call `get_position_value` with each of the valid possible moves. Then we either get the minimum or the maximum of all of those values, depending on who's turn it is:

```python
def calculate_position_value(board):
    valid_move_indexes = get_valid_move_indexes(board)

    values = [get_position_value(play_move(board, m))
              for m in valid_move_indexes]

    min_or_max = choose_min_or_max_for_comparison(board)
    position_value = min_or_max(values)

    return position_value
```

We can see below that `choose_min_or_max_for_comparison` returns the `min` function if it is _O's_ turn and `max` if it is _X's_ turn:

```python
def choose_min_or_max_for_comparison(board):
    turn = get_turn(board)
    return min if turn == CELL_O else max
```

Below are the winning percentages for different combinations of minimax and random players, with 1000 games played for each combination:

We can see that if both players play perfectly, only a draw is possible, but _X_ is more likely to win if both players play at random.
